an exploration of 13 months of retail electricity usage data for my apartment.  I was paying above market electricity prices - ** 17.2 cents per kilowatt hour** - with [Reliant Energy](https://www.reliant.com/en/residential/join-now/new.jsp).  For that premium rate, Reliant did provide access to my ["Green Button"](http://www.greenbuttondata.org/) hourly electricity usage data, in this [arcane xml-spreadsheet](https://github.com/micahstubbs/my-electricity/tree/master/ReliantGreenButtonData).

armed with this knowledge, I set out to select a new retail electricity vendor that would offer a market rate at attractive terms.

[`electricity_plans.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micahstubbs/my-electricity/master/electricity_plans.js) is a custom function for this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-231CUqrFUtJOeXamyEtrQ_sj0Q-NCW9nQitKVCLBw/edit?usp=sharing) where I backtest several plans from multiple vendors.  

after modeling plans from several vendors, I selected [one](https://www.infiniteenergy.com/api/efl/CenterPoint/The_All-Inclusive_6_mo) that had the best combination of low effective price -**9.4 cents per kilowatt hour** - based on my historical usage and positive reviews online.
